My Dear Sir,

The Manuscript entitled **Mappæ Clavicula**, signifying the Little Key of Drawing, or Painting, is a small duodecimo volume of sixty-seven leaves of vellum, written in the twelfth century. It appears to be perfect, except a leaf torn out between pp. 64 and 65 of the modern paging, and a little cropping in two leaves.

It was purchased at Paris, in 1824, from the Rev. Mons. Allard, Curé of the church of Saint Eustache, and had previously belonged to Mons. J. Rabaut.

I have always considered it to be one of the most curious and interesting treatises relating to the art of painting, or rather the composition of colours for painting, in existence. It is very remarkable in many respects. Its antiquity exceeds that of all other works treating of similar arts with which I am acquainted. The character of the writing appears to be that used in England or Flanders in the time of Henry 2nd; but from an English word being used in the work the presumption will be, of the two nations, in favour of England. Should it be an English work, we may fairly infer that these "secrets" are those which were known to our Saxon artists and artificers. The passage which quotes the English word is in chapter 190. where the shrub "caprifolium" is translated "goat tree."* This is a singular circumstance, and seems to me to indicate, as I said before, that the author or the transcriber was an Englishman, for had he been of any other nation he would most naturally have translated it by the language of his own country. Moreover, in the very next chapter, he mentions the herb "_greningpert_," a corruption, I suspect, of "_greningwert_," the Saxon ƿ being easily mistaken for a _p_; (and we know that several English names of herbs end in _wort_,* as St. John's Wort, etc.) which I consider an additional mark of his being an English author. It is evidently the work of a person well practised in the arts which he describes, and he has apparently some classical learning, since there is little doubt that he had read Vitruvius, for he gives an extract from him, although he does not mention him by name; the chapter on Brick Walls, "De latericiis Parietibus," being, I believe, taken from that author, and probably also the chapter on Lime and Sand.

*) The term "gate" for "goat" explains the reason why the family of Yate bear three gates for their arms, and a goat's head for their crest; a gate formerly being pronounced (as it is now in some counties) a yat, or yate: both are, in fact, puns upon the name.

*) Wurt in old German and Saxon signifies a herb, as we know from the Latin name of Wurtzburgh, which is translated Herbipolis.

The author does not confine himself to the composition of colours, but treats of a variety of other subjects, in a concise and simple manner, and generally very intelligibly; as for instance, Architecture, Mensuration of Altitudes, the Art of War, etc. The various articles on these and other subjects may be summed up in the following: namely, 1. Softening gold so as to mould it with the fingers; 2. To melt gold without the aid of fire; 3. To write in gold, silver, and quicksilver letters; 4. To gild other metals; 5. To restore tarnished silver to its brilliancy; 6. To gild on stone, wood, glass, and leather; 7. To proportion buildings; 8. To build in water; 9. To build brick walls; 10. The choice of sand; 11. To make mortar; 12. To make glue for wood or bone; 13. To make glass; 14. To stain glass with various colours; 15. To stain or dye leather, bone, horn, and wood; 16. To varnish paintings; 17. To prepare size for painting on walls; 18. To make soap and starch.

He gives ns instructions in other arts, which have been long lost; such as, 1. The composition of Niello; 2. Encaustic; 3. Ancient ink; 4. The mode of softening glass, crystal, and ivory; 5. Of making fiery arrows, and empoisoning them; 6. The mode of using the battering-ram, etc.

The variety of synonyms given to the same trees, shrubs, or herbs in pp. 238 and 239 will be interesting to the botanist, and valuable to the artist, for by some one of these different names he may be able to identify a plant which would otherwise remain unknown to him. One secret the author appears to be afraid of entrusting even to his own son, or, at all events, not to his book, for he conceals the names of the materials under fictitious letters, as in chapter 212. where he speaks of the composition of a water which may be set on fire and yet the material which it surrounds shall remain unconsumed. His mode of measuring heights is simple and easy: the method of making fiery and empoisoned arrows, and of using, preserving, and improving the battering-ram, throw light upon the details of the art of warfare of that time. It may be doubtful, however, whether the soap-boiler of the present day could improve his own system by the author's.

He makes a curious remark on the nature of the ox and the horse, by a paradox, observing, that if oxen drink first, then there will be enough water for both oxen and horses; but, if the horses drink first, there will not be sufficient either for horses or oxen.

His instructions for writing in gold and silver letters are particularly interesting in the present day, when so much labour and ingenuity is expended in reviving, by fac-similes, ancient illuminated MSS.

It is observable that most of the countries, in which the materials quoted were produced, are in the East; for instance, Alexandria, Ethiopia, Persia, Cappadocia, Egypt, etc., shewing that the principal trade for these articles lay in that direction. Allusion is sometimes made to Greece and Spain, often to Italy, but rarely to Germany, France, or England. There are some passages which seem to indicate the work to have been compiled in Italy, or at least that these arts were originally developed there.

Among the more interesting facts, which the author relates, is one, which appears to me to fix a boundary to the question as to the origin of Painting in Oils, and to shew that it was, at all events, _after_ the period when this work was written by the author, that that art was discovered. The statement I allude to is this:--- In describing the mode of preserving pictures from injury by water he recommends the artist "to lay over them a coating of oil of _Cicini_."* It is clear from this that pictures were not at that time painted with colours ground up with oil, for, if they had been so, they would not need a fresh coating to preserve them from water. Now it would be very extraordinary if a person, so conversant in the composition and the use of colours as this author seems to be, who must have had consequently much intercourse with painters, should be totally ignorant of the art of mixing the colours with oil, if it really was in general practice. I may adduce, in corroboration of this supposition, the picture of Lorenzo of Venice,* painted in 1369, and described by Zanetti, which shows clearly that the practice, recommended by the author of Mappæ Clavicula, was still in use two hundred years after his own time; therefore, when it is stated that Theophilus mentions painting in oil as known before the eleventh century, the two statements seem to be irreconcilable.

*) Chapter 109.

*) See Mrs. Merrifield's "Cennini on Painting."

I have, however, a MS. of the Latin Gospels of the tenth century, in which the figures of the Evangelists are deemed, by a lady skilled in painting, to have been done in oil. They are evidently of the Greek style of painting, as may be seen by comparison with other paintings in my Greek MSS. Should this conjecture be well-founded, it would be plain that Oil-painting must have been known _before_ the _eleventh_ century. Perhaps I may hazard a conjecture, that Theophilus (a Greek name) was a Greek artist, who came into Italy, and imparted the knowledge of his art to the monk Ruggiero, and that the author of the Clavicula, being an Englishman, and far distant from Italy, had not yet acquired that secret of mixing the oil and colours, which Theophilus may have known.

To return to the contents of the Clavicula.

Another object of interest is the explanation of the Symbols of Weights and Measures, which partly resemble those now in use, and approximate also to those given by Rabanus, Abbot of Fulda, in some cases, but not in all.

Near the end of the MS. he gives two or three cases of natural magic, one of which is the now well-known experiment of water quickly whirled round in a vessel, and yet not falling out.

One of the most valuable entries in the book is one connected with philology, namely, the alphabet of Runes, if they are Runes, but which I am inclined to think arc Oscan, or very early Greek, and derived originally from the Persepolitan, or Babylonian character. Those who will compare the earliest known Greek inscriptions, such as the Sigæan, will see at onee that they are made in the same cuneiform manner as the Babylonian and Persepolitan letters, and appear to have very nearly the same form of strokes or lines, with the advantage of a more simple combination of these strokes, so as to make one character or letter. The Chinese character retains its Babylonian form to this day; and the Runes of the North I consider to be equally derived from the Babylonian, although arbitrarily altered from the Southern form, perhaps according to the will and taste of the leader who led his bands northward after the dispersion of Babel, or perhaps at a later time by some Priest or Magus of the tribe, or they may be the same characters altered in the lapse of time, like some of our own from the ancient Saxon. Some of the letters in this volume correspond with the characters of the "Lettras desconocidas," or unknown letters of Spain, as may be seen by referring to Laborde's Spain, Don Gabriel's Sallust, Velasquez, and the Oscan monuments. Those which correspond with Laborde are, ---

The alphabetical names of ag, berch, cen, derhu, I do not remember to have met with before.

I have thus, my dear Sir, at your request, undertaken the above description of this volume, but I have felt myself totally incompetent to enter upon the task in such a manner as it deserves. To do it justice I consider could only be performed by some one, who, like yourself, had studied those arts which the book describes. I must request you therefore to pardon all faults, both of criticism, of judgment, and of simple description, and beg to remain,

My dear Sir, very truly yours, 

**Thos. Phillipps.**

# Incipit Libellus Dictus Mappæ Clavicula.

Sensim per partes discuntur quælibet artes.  
Artis pictorum prior est factura colorum;  
Post, ad mixturas convertat mens tua curas;  
Tunc opus exerce, sed ad unguem cuncta coerce,  
Ut sit ad ornatum quod pinxeris, et quasi natum.  
Postea multorum documentis ingeniorum  
Ars opus augebit, sicut liber iste docebit.

## De Vermiculo.

Si vis facere Vermiculum, accipe ampullam vitream et lini deforis de luto, et sic accipe unum pondus vivi argenti, et duo pondera sulfuris albi aut crocei coloris, et mitte ipsam ampullam super 3. aut 4. petras, et adhibe ignem in circuitu ampulle ex carbonibus, ignem tamen lentissimum, et sic cooperies ampullam ex parvissima tegula: et, quando videris fumum exire ex ore ampullæ blavum, cooperi: et, quando exierit fumus crocei coloris, iterum cooperi: et, quando videris exire fumum rubeum quasi vermiculum, sic tolle ignem, et habes vermiculum optimum in ampulla.

## De Lazorio.

Si vis facere Lazorium optimum, accipe ollam novam que nunquam fuit in opus, et mitte in eam laminas purissimi argenti, quantas vis, et sic cooperi ollam et sigilla; et mitte ipsam ollam in vindemia que est projecta de torculari, et illic bene cooperi de ipsa vindemia, et serva bene usque ad 15. dies; et sic aperies ipsam ollam, et illum florem qui est in circuitu laminarum argenti excuties in nitidissimo vase. Quod si amplius volueris habere, iterum fac quod supra scriptum est.

## Item.

Si aliud Lazorium volueris facere, accipe ampullam purissimi cupri, et mitte in eam calcem usque ad medium, et sic imple illam fortissimo aceto; et ita cooperi et sigilla; et tunc mitte ipsam ampullam in terra, aut in alio aliquo calido loco, et ita dimitte usque ad unum mensem; et postea aperies ampullam. Istud Lazorium non est tam bonum sicut aliud, tamen valet ad lignum et maceriam.

## Item.

Tertium Lazorium si vis facere, accipe flores blavos et tere, et exprime in mundissimo vase; et fac prius campum in ligno et in pargameno de albo plumbo; et mitte desuper, quando fuerit siccum, ipsum colorem, et tantum ita fac, usque quo videas ipsum colorem esse similem Lazorii.

## De Viridi.

Si vis facere Viride Grecum, accipe ollam novam, et mitte in eam laminas purissimi cupri, et sic imple ipsam ollam fortissimo aceto, et ita cooperi et sigilla; et mitte ipsam ollam in aliquo calido loco, aut in terra, et ita dimitte usque ad sex menses, et tunc aperies ipsam ollam, et que in ea inveneris mitte super tabulam ligneam, et mitte ad solem siccare.

## Item.

Si vis facere Viride Rotomagense, accipe laminas purissimi cupri, et lini ipsas laminas in circuitu de optimo sapone; et mitte ipsas laminas in novam ollam, et sic imple ipsam fortissimo aceto, et ita cooperi et sigilla, et (mitte) in aliquo calido loco usque ad 15. dies; et ita aperies ollam, et executies laminas super tabulam ligneam, et mittas ad solem siccare.

## De Minio.

Si vis facere Minium, rubeum vel album, accipe ollam novam, et mitte in eam tabulas plumbeas, et imple ipsam ollam fortissimo acceto, et ita cooperies, et sigillabis; et mittes ipsam ollam in calido loco, et ita dimitte usque ad unum mensem; et postea accipe ollam, et discooperies, et quod fuerit in circuitu tabularum plumbearum excuties in alio vase fictili, et sic pones ad ignem, et semper movebis ipsum colorem, et quando videbis ipsum colorem effectum album, sicuti nix, tolles de illo quantum tibi placuerit, et ipse color vocatur Cerussa. Reliquum vero dimittes ad ignem et semper movebis, usque quo sit factus rubeus, sicuti aliud minium; et ita tolles de igne, et dimittes in ipso vase refrigerare.

## De diversis Coloribus.

Colores in pargameno spissi, et clari, hii sunt: Azorium, Vermiculum, Sanguis draconis, Carum, Minium, Folium, Auripigmentum, Viride Grecum, Gravetum Indicum, Brunum, Crocus, Minium rubeum vel album, Nigrum optimum ex carbone vitis. Hii omnes colores destemperantur a glarea.

## De Mixtionibus.

Quod si volueris scire naturas et mixtiones istorum colorum, et qui sint sibi contrarii, diligenter aurem appone.

Azorium misce cum albo plumbo, incide de indico, matiza de albo plumbo.

Vermiculum purum incides de bruno, aut de sanguine draconis, matizabis de auripigmento. Vermiculum misces cum albo plumbo, et facies colorem qui vocatur Rosa; incides de vermiculo, matizabis de albo plumbo. Item, facies colorem de sanguine draconis, et de auripigmento; incides de bruno, matizabis de auripigmento.

Carum minium incides de bruno, matizabis de rubeo minio. Item, facies Rosam de caro minio et albo plumbo; incides de caro minio, matizabis de albo plumbo.

Folium incides de bruno, matizabis de albo plumbo. Item, misces folium cum albo plumbo; incides de folio, matizabis de albo plumbo.

Auripigmentum incides de vermiculo, et ipsi matizatura non est, quia stercorat omnes alios colores.

Tamen si vis facere Gladum Viride, misces auripigmentum cum nigro; incides de nigro, matizabis de auripigmento.

Si vis facere similem, accipe azorium, misces cum albo plumbo; incides de azorio, matizabis de albo plumbo; et quando fuerit siccum cooperies de claro croco.

## Temperatura.

Viride Grecum distemperabis cum aceto; incides de nigro, matizabis de albo, quod fit de cornu cervi. Item, misces viride cum albo plumbo; incides de viride, matizabis de albo plumbo. Gravetam incides de viride, matizabis de albo plumbo. Crocum incides de vermiculo, matizabis de albo plumbo. Indicum incides de nigro, matizabis de azorio. Item, misces Indicum cum albo, incides de azorio, matizabis de albo plumbo. Brunum incides de Nigro, matizabis de rubeo minio. Item, facies de bruno et albo plumbo Rosam; incides de bruno, matizabis de albo plumbo. Item, misces Crocum cum albo plumbo, incides de croco, matizabis de albo plumbo; minium rubeum incides de bruno, matizabis de albo plumbo. Item, misces Minium cum bruno; incides de nigro, matizabis de rubeo plumbo. Item, facias Carnaturam de rubeo plumbo et albo; incides de vermiculo, matizabis de albo plumbo.

## Qui contrarii sibi sint Colores.

Modo si vis scire qui colores sibi sint contrarii, hoc est. Auripigmentum non concordat cum folio nec cum viridi, nec rubeo plumbo, nec cum albo. Viride non concordat cum folio.

Si vis facere campos, fac pulcram rosam de vermiculo et albo. Item, fac campum de folio distemperato cum calce. Item, fac campum de viridi distemperato cum acceto. Item, fac campum de ipso viridi, et quando fuerit siccum cooperies de caule.

Si vis scribere de auro, accipe pulverem auri, et distempera cum glute ipsius pargameni in quo debes scribere, et ad ignem de ipso auro cum glute scribe, et quando littera sicca fuerit, bruni de planissima petra, aut de dente apri. Item, si inde volueris vestimentum, aut picturam aliam facere, sicut superius dixi, aurum mittes in pargameno, incides de incausto, aut de indico, et matizabis de auripigmento.

# Incipit Prologus sequentis Operis.

Multis et mirabilibus in hec meis conscriptis libris cure nobis fuit exponere commentarium, non ut tangentes sacros libros, et multum laborantes nichilque efficientes videamur, sed distinguentes istam heresim fatali munere concessam, omnem picturam et laborem que in ipsis actibus sint inveniamus ista volentibus perspicere.

Operatio ex auro, ne vanus sit labor curaque, perficiendi, sed et cum lucro, commixtionem facere utilitas non modica erit. Cum aurum ignei coloris aspectum acceperit, accipies ferri Indici limaturas denariorum 2. teris optime, et mittis in aurum; delude battis laminam, ut non sit pingue. Utere autem misio et absconde in aliud; cumque visum fuerit sufficienter habere, calefacies modicum, ut focum tetigisse tantum videatur. Inde autem cum tuleris, in novam patellam mittis, et operies. In coctura vero laminæ utere misio. Exercens autem purgabis, et ut voles ita expendes, et quantumcunque fuerit, misce nitri partes 2. et plumbi 1. molipdinis partem 1.

Recipe in vas vitreum, et, cum siccaverit, teris, ut hilariora fiant. Scribe autem calamo aut pincello pictorio. Si velis ut diffusum sit abundantius quod scribas, conteris cum his, que supra scripta sunt, separatim, auripigmenti scissilis partes 4. elidrii partem 1. cribrans et miscens. Conteris cum predictis tantum quantum tibi videatur esse equale ei auro quod in mortario est; et conteris, ut predictum est, et scribe.

Si vero rubrum velis facere, admiscebis cypri partem 1. conflabis autem æs primum frequenter, donec fiet testeum, et conflabis cum predicta ponderatione. Si vero feminæ imaginem formare volueris, sume partem 1. et argenti pondera 4. et fit mixtum, demonstrans corpus femineum splendescens, cum fuerit extersum. Posthac inventum est ut fierent et nigre deorum imagines ex auro, et argento, et ere, et aliis permixtionibus. Mixtura autem et confectio in sequentibus demonstrabitur.

## 55\. Deauratio omnium, si veils deaurare, sive argenteum vas, sive ereum.

Accipies laminam auream valde tenuem, forficabis minutatim, et mittis in mortarium: adicis argenti vivi modicum, et dimittis modico tempore. Adicis postea nitri aliquid, et aceti; teris pumice diligenter, donec fiat glutinis pinguedo, propter abundantiam argenti vivi. Hec autem mittis in pannum mundum, et exprimis, ex quo plurimum argenti vivi exiet. Tunc sumis vas, extergis pumice tenui, calefacis, et, dum refrigerat, deinde inungis de malagmate, et calefacis iterum vas, et rursus inungis, et igni dabis. Impinguaturque aurum solum. Cum itaque color placuerit, postmodum calefacies vas, et mittis in aqua melanterie, (_id est_, aqua caligaliorum qua denigrantur coria;) et tunc teris. Si vero vas ereum deaures, post quam id exterseris, unguis alumine liquido, nam non recipiat malagma.

Accipe laminas stagneas, contingis aceto et alumine, et conglutinabis glutine cartineo. Deinde sumis crocum et gluten purum, (_id est_, perspicuum et limpidum); infunde in aqua cum aceto e limaturis: igne levi coquis, cum effulserit gluten inunge stagneas laminas, et apparebunt tibi auree. Vide autem ne elidrium ammisceas; si autem trita omnia feceris, noli mittere gluten, confirmabitur enim tibi opus; et si cum glutine sit concretum, ad auri scriptionem adicies elenusiam, ut perducas.

## 61\. Deauratio facilis.

Sandaracam aurei coloris, et auripigmentum scissile, et dragantum, tere cum felle caprino et ovi interioribus, et ungue ante oleo novum opus; et, cum siccatum fuerit, habebit colorem primo auri similem.

[Inserted at the foot of the page, "Auri solutio --- Fel taurinum mitte in vas novum, et dimitte in vase novo diebus 6. et postea liquabis, et cum extraxeris, conjunge et misce."]

## 68\. (_Quomodo scribitur de auro._)

Sumis aurum, et mittis in vas novum, et adicis fel taurinum; obtera diebus 3. et, si videris dissolutum esse, effunde fel sensim, et adicis aliud fel cum aceto; atque inde rursum transfer in ereum vas purum; et cum tepefeceris vas purum ablue, et sicca. Ydrocollam adjunge, et sic scribe. Quod, si triduò solutum non fuerit, pluribus dimitte, et solvitur.

## 69\. (_De vitri coctione._)

Sumis vas vitreum, solidum, cavum, quod mortarii formam habeat, caraxas mirio de lapide, omnem ejus curvaturam subradens, in formam 10. littere. Pone cinerem, unde vitrum conflari debeat, in conflatorium, et asperges sanguine draconis crudo. Si autem crudum habere non voles, fac ex albumine ovorum, et succo visci medicamen, et in eo sanguine cinerem asperge, et sic excoque. Coctum, autem, cum in vitrum velis producere vas ad cujus debeat formam produci, item eodem sanguine delini, sicque factum, scias vitrum fragile in naturam fortioris metalli formari. Rumpere tamen hoc modo potes. Accipe sanguinem galli, et tere cum eo lapidem celidonium, admixta urina, cum toto lotio singularis non ammixto, addes etiam dragantum, et omnia simul mixta immitte in illud vas vitreum; et videbis artem, et ingenio vinci ingenium. Item, hoc ipsum, si in vas plumbeum vel stagneum miseris, solidatur ut es vel ferrum, tamen sine sanguine galli.

## 70\. Idem, (_id est, auri scriptio_) quasi decus.

Facias vas asperum, et quasi limatum; deinde mittis mel Atticum, deline aurum quod produxeris in avene modum, leviter circumfer manum, et, cum confricatur, leve fiat. Deinde postquam omne aurum, vel quanta volueris ejus pars, fuerit attrita, adice aquam melli et collue subtiliter, et liquato melle, invenies suhsidere aurum liquidum, et line. In hoc, igitur, quod residebit, adice sufficienter gluten taurinum, vel icciocollam,* vel gummi, quod te habere in vase propter usus oportet. Hinc itaque litteras scribe, et signa; oblinis et tecta subungis, et omne, quod volueris, aureum apparebit, vel cum unxeris, vel scripseris; et, cum siccaverit, dente frica, ut delinitum splendidum appareat. Hoc verò consilio, et ferrum, et plumbum, et eramentum solvis, et scribe, et inungis quod vis.

*) Pro "icthyocollam."

## 71\. (_Item, auri scriptio._)

Plumbum sepius liquefacis, et in aqua diffundis; et, cum hoc frequenter feceris in eadem aqua ubi plumbum refundis, exempto plumbo, confla aurum, et ibi dimitte. Frangitur enim in minutissimas partes; has tolle, et teris, et solvitur: huic adicis glutinis suprascripti quantum volueris; et utere ad que velis. Quod, verò, in ultimis arboris cavernis gummi invenitur, in his que deaurautur vitreis, si ante eo ungantur, bene retinet aurum.

## 72\. (_Argenti confectio._)

Misium ciprium, et sandaracam,* et elidrium, equalibus portionibus accipis: et aqua in qua cocta sint folia sandaracis montani (_id est_, papaveris agrestis, quod et ammonia dicitur) facis glutinis pinguedinem, et confla argentum, sed optimum; et, cum fuerit calidum, intinguis in predicta aqua.

Intinguis autem de medicamento, quod de coctione exit.

## 74\. (Eramentum candidum facere.)

Sumis cuprum productile, quod cardarium (_sic_)* dicitur, vel es ignitum, productum, facis laminas quibus substernis, et super aspergis cathmiam albam, tritam diligenter. (Nascitur in Dalmatia) qua utuntur erarii, et argilla oblinies fornacem diligenter, ita ne respiret, die una. Postea aperies, et, si bene habuerit, uteris; si non, secundò coquis cum cathmia, ut supra, quod si melius exierit cuprum caldarium permiscetur auro.

Cum infusa fuerit, bulliet, et sonum dat stridoris: alumen vero viride, et porphirium, omnia tinget, extra berillum et onichinum. Terra nigra vocatur, eo quod est fusca. Nascitur enim in Egypto, et Africa, et in Evilath, et in Italia. Nascitur enim in humidis locis, et in vallibus. Ex ea tinguitur roseum, commixta cum aceto, et cocta, reddet colorem; et post hoc revertitur in coccum.

## 135\. De lapide focario.

Lapis, qui dicitur focarius, ex quo eramen tingitur, nascitur in omnibus locis. Est et alius similis dum percutitur emittit scintillas raras et magnas; et est rubeus et igneus, colorem habens eramenti; et dum in ignem missus fuerit, ut probetur, incenditur, et colorem non mutat. Collectum autem et contritum minutatim, collecta massa modica, et cum letamine bovino, aut caprino, et palea cooperto, incendes per dies et noctes, donec consumetur ipsum letamen in fornace. Ipsum autem potes coquere, et eramen, et plumbum; et, postquam refrigescet, colligitur ipse lapis, qui jam coctus est, et in prima pensione, pensas libras 300. in prima coctura. In quam mittis carbonum cofinos 18. fasces de teda; et dum ingressi fuerint magistri ad opera, et incensa omnia dimittes stare ea, et refrigerare, ut non currat, si est plumbum, aut ferrum, aut cetera metalla, eo quod piger fiat. Et, dum refrigescit, comminue minutatim, et in fornace conflatur, et operaris ex eo.

## 136\. De lapide fisso.

Lapis fissus nascitur in Capadocia, Asia, Hiberia, et in Italia. Est enim fuscus et fortis. Dum comminutus fuerit, invenies in eo venas albas; et, cum incensus fuerit, fiet rubeus; quem Alexandrini vocant "cathmiam," eo quod conflet vitrum. Nascitur autem in altis locis, et ventosis. Est enim lapis crepidinosus.

## 137\. Quomodo fiat cera-marmor ex gagate, et de lapide tracho.

Lapis gagatis similis coloris auripigmenti, non enim sic multum viridis; qui, dum rumpitur, ignem emittit, et finditur in laminas; propter quod Alexandrini vocant eam "petram planam," ex qua fit cera-marmor. Quem, si pisas subtiliter, et mittis libram de ipso lapide, et 2. de aurocollon, et aquæ libras 5. et bis et tercio facis bullire, assidue commovens, et commiscens, fiet cera-marmor.

## 138\. De lapide tracho.

Lapis trachias nascitur in universis locis; est enim viridis, fissus, fuscus; combustus, fiet albus; mittitur in cathmia in mundatione argenti.

## 139\. (_De Caucucecaumenon._)

Caucucecaumenon fit hoc modo. Ex eramento mundissimo facies petalas, mittasque in usitatum ipsas petalas, et sulphur vivum tritum; et iterum sterne petalas in cacabo: deinde super sparge sulfur, et ita facias donec impleas ipsum cacabum. Deinde, in fornace vitrarii posito cacabo, coque diebus 3. et, dum refrigescit, confringes eum minute. Adde alumen Asianum, secundum compositionem sulfuris; similiter cooperiatur ipse cacabus, et liniatur cum argilla, et ponatur secundum dispositionem prioris, et coquatur per dies 6. Ipse autem, dum confringitur, solvat caucucecaumenon ad gluten aureum.

## 140\. Compositio electri.

Electrum fiet hoc modo. Pone 2. partes argenti, et eramenti tertiam, et auri tertiam (_sic_); ita ut aurum et eramentum equis ponderibus fiant.

## 141\. Gluten auri ad fistulas.

De chrisoclabo astici ʒ. 1. caucucecaumenon ʒ. 1. affronitri ʒ. 1. saponem ex oleo sine calce ʒ. 1. vitrioli solidi 2. aceti dimidiam ʒ. aque ʒ. 1. comminue, et commisce semotim eramen; cetera in unum commisce, et compone modicum, ut tepescat gluten de canilis chrisoclabi.

## 142\. Compositio litargiri ex plumbo.

Litargirum, aliud ex plumbo, aliud autem ex argento, fit. Compositionem, quæ ex plumbo fit, sic compones. Plumbum impone in cacabo potius femineum et molle, et solves illud bene; deinde, cum solutum fuerit, pistillo ligneo frica plumbum incessanter: mitte cinerem similiter, et non desinas terendo quoad usque facias eum ut pulverem; et post laves eum aqua. Si autem stringi volueris eum, et fieri spissum, mitte in cacabo, vel in cabilo, vel in camiolos (? cannolos) cum oleo; et calefactum adimatur, et, dum refrigescit, franges caniclos.

## 143\. Alia compositio litargiri ex argento.

Compositionem litargiri ex argento sic facies. Confla argentum, et illa sordidatio, que ex eo exit, trita cum oleo intrat, secundum priorem compositionem: plus autem incenditur propter fortitudinem argenti. Plumbi autem litargirum, ante quam solidetur, intrat cum aqua in bituminatione testea. Dum autem extrinxerit, ubi volueris, necessarium erit.

## 144\. Inauratio musii operis.

Facies petalum vitreum spissum supra petalum eramentinum, ita ut incensum non cohereat. Posthac tolle petalum aureum super petalam vitri, et super petalam auri aliud pone ex vitro multum subtile; et mitte utrumque in fornacem, donec inchoet solvi petalum vitri; et sic eice ut refrigescat. Posthac frica faciem ejus in tabula plumbea smirutata, donec attenues faciem ejus, et coloras illud.

## 145\. De tabulis smirutatis.

Facies tabulam de plumbo, et tolles smirram vivam; tere bene, et asperge tabulam totam, defricans semel vitrum, donec confringatur pulvis smirræ ad tabulam, et posthac operaris quod necesse est cum aqua.

## 146\. De coloratione musii.

Ad colorationem autem tolle tabulam, et caraxa illam curtatim, et terens cretam argenti subtiliter, asperge tabulam, et defrica bene ipsum vitrum, donec coloretur.

Eraminis mundi limati partes 2. et aluminis Asiani, in mortario diligenter pisati et cribrati, partem 1. commisce in caliculo, et pone ad prunas, donec confletur, et commisceatur alumen cum eramine. Ipsam vero formam vasorum quam facere volueris prius munda urina, et sic funde eramen, quod in prima quidem, ac secunda inflatura, retinet colorem, in tertia perdet, cum limaveris, et batis illud continet colorem: si frangatur inutile erit.

Omnis gemma durioris naturæ, sicut jacinctus, et smaragldus, alemandina, carbunculus, fricantur ismiri lapide in plumbea tabula, usque dum formam accipiat, qualem illi cavator dare voluerit. Deinde fricatur in lotura ejusdem pulveris, in quo prius fricabatur, usque ad lenitatem. Splendificatur verò uno modo, sed jacinctus in pulvere lapidis igniarii combusti in lamina ciprea. Ceteræ vero splendificantur aut pulvere, facto de cimolia, aut ex fragmento testeo, quod fit ex vasis antiquis, in astula lignea tremuli, aut alni. At gemmæ mollioris naturæ fricantur, usque ad formam, in pulvere lapidis arenatii super plumbum, sicut sunt amethistus, cristallus, onichinus, jaspis, berillus; deinde fricantur usque ad lenitatem in lotura ejusdem pulveris. Splendificantur in pulvere lapidis igniarii combusti super laminam cipream. Vitrum verò fricandum est in lapide arenatio usque ad formam; deinde super plumbum, in pulvere minuto lapidis arenatii, usque ad lenitatem: deinde super hastulam ligneam, in confricatura testæ antiquæ fit, in cote cum aqua; novissime in cimolia splendorem accipit, et hoc in hastula lignea.

Frangitur ismiris lapis malleo super incudem durum in pulverem minutum; et fiat tabula de plumbo, quæ conficitur super scamnum ligneum; et pulvis illius lapidis super illam aspergitur, et in eo qualiscunque gemma formanda est; fricatur cum aqua, usque dum formam accipiat, quam ei cavator dare voluerit: deinde sumitur idem pulvis et lavatur: ex eo, quod minutissimum fuerit, super aliam laminam plumbeam ponitur, et in eo quælibet gemma fricatur usque ad lenitatem.

Sumitur lignum grossitudine minimi digiti, longitudine palmæ unius, et in ejus summitate pix calida, mixta cum tegula trita, ponitur; quæ mixtura duas partes pulveris de tegula, et tertiam picis, habere debet; in qua postea calefacta gemma, quæ fricanda est, sic ponenda est ut adhereat.

Eris pulvis, vel limatura, teritur cum aceto in eneo mortario, cum sale et alumine, usque ad mellis spissitudinem. Aliqui pro aceto aqua utuntur. Denique bene purgatum ferrum, et leviter calefactum, hac mixtura inungitur, et fricatur, donec colorem eris accipiat: tunc aqua abluitur, et teritur; et, sicut es, vel argentum, deauratur, et calefactum, recedente vivo argento, sicut mos est, ut splendorem accipiat ferro defricatur.

Alumen rotundum, et sal, quod gemma vocatur, et calcantum, ex aceto acerrimo, teruntur in ereo mortario; his ferrum purgatum cum ferula, vel alia qualibet molli hastula defricatur; et, cum eraminis colorem habuerit, extergitur, et deauratur, ac deinde, exfumigato argento vivo, aqua refrigeratum, usque ad splendorem ferro, valde plano et limpido, defricatur.

## 147\. Cathmie compositio.

## 149\. Anfinus sic fit.

Tolles plumbum molle, et solves in vase testeo forti, ut sufferat trituram: tolles pistillum, et mittes carbones cum cinere super plumbum, priusquam refrigescat; permoves illud cum pistello leniter et bene, donec attenues et subtilies ipsum plumbum: post hoc mittes in gabata lignea, et delavas. Deinde componas in cacabo novo cum sulfure, et decoques per dies 3.

## 150\. Pandii compositio.

## 163\. De lapide olimpio.

Lapis olimpius nascitur in petrosis locis, et est duorum colorum, niger habens guttas albas: percussus sole, sicut sulfur, ignem emittit.

## 164\. De lapide flavite.

Lapis flavites nascitur in terra nigra: dum autem a sole percussus fuerit, infusus fiet prassinus, ex quo nascitur prassinus color.

## 165\. De lapide rubeo.

Lapis rubeus nascitur in diversis locis; de quo et mortarium, quo aurum teritur, fiet.

Flores neulacis (quod Grecè "tapsia" dicitur, alii "cameleonta" vocant) colliges, et repones: deinde ungue manus tuas sapone cocto sine calce, et defrica inter manus tuas ipsos flores, et pones in vas. Post hoc, iterum unctis manibus ex ipso sapone, eosdem flores defricas diutius, et iterum repones; et hoc facies donec ipsi flores consumentur. Post consummationem autem florum collectam confectionem cooperi diligenter in vase, in loco calido, donec eam veneti coloris esse noscas. Cum autem veneti fuerit, non operies illud nisi tantum panno. Deinde sume folia viridia de uuato (_sic_) exnerviato, et decoque cum urina expumata, donec solvantur predicta folia, et tamdiu coque, quoadusque consumetur urina, et pinguescat ipsa coctio; et mitte refrigerare.

Hoc modo polies. Pone pulverem de smeril super tabulam plumbeam, et parum de saliva humecta, et paulatim tritando, sepe respice vel ne consumatur. Secatum, hoc modo colorabis. Bisum cauculum tamdiu crema, donec in pulverem redigatur; sicca ad diem, inde fac pulverem subtilissimum, vel de levi pumice, vel de cristallo cremato fac subtilem pulverem; et extende corduan super tabulam, et cum pulvere et sputo tuo super corduan fricando lapidem colorabis. Si pumicem non habes, de antiquis lateribus, unde scutellæ fiebant, fac pulverem, qui tantundem valet; vel cum cupero filo, sine detrimento, colorabis.

## 192\. Quianus autem nascitur sic.

Quianon uualtalasion nascitur enim in locis humidis. Nascitur enim ex rore, estivo tempore; colligitur autem sic. Tollens colliges eam, et repones ad solem, donec siccetur: postquam desiccabitur, teres bene; deinde tolles cocleam marinam majorem, et lavas bene, et terens mittes ex ipsa coclea libras 30. de uualtalasion libras 2. sapone libras 10. lazurin ǯ. 3. de sapone autem ex oleo leviter cocto partem. Omnia commixta et trita repone in vase novo testeo, et operi de letamine, et dimitte diebus 60.

Perpensum ante commixtionem specierum marinarum tritum bene commisces, secundum mensuram coctionis. Quiani libra 1. psimithin ⍮ 1. ista trita et commixta cum urina expumata.

Hæc omnia exposuimus ex terrenis maritimis floribus, vel etiam herbis; ita exposuimus virtutes vel operationes earum in parietibus, lignis, lintheolis, vel etiam pellibus, et omnibus pictorum instrumentis, ista memoramus omnium operationes, qui in parietibus simplicem, in ligno cere commixtum suscepit lignum simplicem cum unctione collon commixtum. In pannum vero cere commixtis coloribus: in pellibus unctio collon commixtum.

Primum metallum, ex quo fit aurum, terra rufa est, amoydis subrubicunda prope ad juxta stantem illi terram est hæc, et alia similis, et dum incenditur perdit colorem, et non est arenosa, sicut illa prior. Nascitur in solanis lucis ea terra, et tale est metallum auri.

Aluminis autem metallum est terra florens.

Eitarin terra est alba, facilis ad pisandum.

Sulfur ex terra nascitur, et ipse incenditur locus: coctum autem ex terra sulpherea oleo mixta coquitur.

Nitrum est sal, qui nascitur in terra, fiet in laminas in tempore cavatur.

Sal scistis nascitur similiter.

Affronitrum, verò, nascitur in loco nitri, priusquam gelet: componitur autem et aliud ex nitro; principale autem spuma, alba, ut nix. Compositum vero prius fuscum est, habet tamen eandem virtutem.

Terra sulphuritana in eodem loco, ubi sulphur, nascitur.

Argentum vivum nascitur ex terra. Nascitur et aliud ex metallo argenti in conflatione.

Auripigmentum metallum est terre; gleba est naturalis quæ in Cipro insula invenitur in metallicis, colore sub auroso, intus habet venas descissas, ut alumen scissum, et in modum stellarum fulgentes.

Prassinus terra est metallizans.

Lulax componitur ex terra et herbis.

## 194\. (_De auri pondere._).

Omne aurum purum cujuslibet ponderis omni argento similiter puro ejusdem tamen ponderis densius est parte sui 24. et insuper 240. quod ita probari potest. Si purissimi auri libra cum eque puri argenti simili poudere sub aqua conferatur 11. denariis, id est 24. et 240. sui parte, aurum gravius argento, vel argentum levius auro, invenietur. Quapropter, si opus aliquod inveneris formatum, cui argentum per commixtionem inesse videatur, scireque volueris quantum auri, quantumve in eo argenti, contineatur, sume argentum sive aurum, et examinato inspectione pondere non minus pensantem massam de utrovis metallo fabricato, atque utrumque opus, scilicet, et massam stantem lancibus imponito, aquisque inmergito. Si argentea fuerit, allevato opere, aurum inclinabitur: hoc tamen ita fiet, ut quot partibus inclinatur aurum, totidem partibus sullevetur argentum; quia, quicquid in ipso opere fuerit, sub aqua preter solitum ponderis ad aurum, propter densitatem, pertinet; quicquid autem levitatis ad argentum, propter raritatem, conferendum est. Et ut hoc facilius possit adverti, considerare debes tam in gravitate auri, quam in levitate argenti, denarios 11. signi(fi)care libram, sicut prima lectionis hujus fronte prefixum est.

## 195\. Compositio nigelli ad aurum.

Sume duas partes almenbuz, _i. e._ argenti, et terciam eris, et aliud tantum alquibriz, _i. e._ sulfur, et aliquid majus, et mitte in fornace in caniculum, ut assetur, et tunc paulatim misce supradicto alquibriz: cum fuerit bene assatum, et misculatum, extrahe foras, et mitte in rigellum, aut in quovis loco, et stari calidum percute ut extenuetur, et dimitte frigesci. Postea super incudem cum tudone (_id est_, martello) diligenter frange minutissime, ut pulvis fiat; et mitte in coculam: postea detempera atincar, _i. e._ burrago, cum aqua; et cum hoc distempera nigellum, et mitte ubi vis; et desuper natroni pulverem asperge, et mitte super carbones usque quo bene currat; et ubi non vis ut currat, mitte cretam distemperatam valde subtilem. Ita factum, extrahe de fornace ut frigescat, et cum lipsatorio acerino lipsa, sed sepe aliquantulum super carbones calefac, et ita usque quo bene se habeat. Postea rade nigellum usque ad almenbuz, et iterum lipsa, ita ut melius scis, et dimitte.

## 196\. Item, nigellum ad almenbuz.

Sume almenbuz, et aliud tantundem eris, et tantum alquibriz, quantum pensant inter almenbuz et es; et fac, ut superius dictum est de auro.

## 197\. Item, ut superius, ut colorem habeat deauratura.

Sume urinam, et aceti modicum, et allium bene tritum, et alquibriz, ut estimas, et similiter misce in concham eream; et ibi mitte 2. laminulas, unam de cupro, et aliam de arrazgaz (_id est_, plumbo) et, cum bene ferbuerit, extrahe, et intingue in aquam frigidam, ita ut fundum non tangat; sed sepe mitte, et trahe, usque quo bene coloret.

## 198\. Ut dulce fiat aurum, ita fac.

Mitte aurum in caniculo in fornace, et misce cum eo alquibriz, et tincar, et simul confla; et fac rigellum, et mitte in salem, postea in aquam, et opera.

## 199\. Item, si vis aurum ponere in pellem.

Si vis aurum ponere in pellem, mitte antea claram de ovo 2. aut 3. vices, in almenbuz 4. in alcazir (_id est_, stannum) 8.

## 200\. Si vis colorare almenbuz.

Si vis colorare almenbuz, sume acetum, et salem, et simul misce, et ibi infunde almenbuz calidum; postea accipe carbones tritos, et lipsa cum panno, aut cum setis.

## 201\. Si vis nectere eramen, aut auricalcum.

Sume duas partes eris, et tertiam stagni: confla simul in fornace, et bene misce; extrahe inde ut frigescat, et inde fac pulverem subtilissimum super ferrum, aut super petram duram, ipsum pulverem misce cum oleo, non nimis rarum nec spissum. Ex hoc unge juncturam eris, aut auricalci, et super asperge pulverem natroni (_id est_, alatroni), et mitte in ignem, ut calescat, et cum fuscello frica, ut bene conectet.

## 202\. Conexio auricalci.

Natroni denarium 1. penso, Cream vini assam quantum estimas, boras denarium 1. penso, cum aqua confice, et inde line auricalcum: postea supersparge pulverem stanni assi: postea subtus carbones in fornace calcfac sicut aurum, usque quo bene conectet.

## 203\. De stagno conjunctionem. (_sic._)

Sapone partem 1. resinæ pini partem 1. natroni partem 1. borax aliquid. Ex his unge stannum, et leviter calefac, sicut scis, usque quo conectet, et calidum in aqua merge.

## 204\. Deauratio facilis.

Accipies laminas stagneas, contingis aceto et alumine, et conglutinabis glutine cartineo; deinde sumis crocum et gluten purum (_id est_, perspicuum et limpidum) infundis aquam cum aceto, et limaturis igne levi coque: cum effluxerit gluten, inunge stagneas laminas, et apparebunt tibi aureæ.

## 205\. Ad gluten stanni.

Duas partes axungiæ, et terciam resinæ, et limaturam stanni pariter mixta, si leviter calefeceris ad ignem solidare poteris.
