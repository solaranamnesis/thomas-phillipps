Middle Hill, 9th January, 1846.

My Dear Sir,

The Manuscript entitled **Mappæ Clavicula**, signifying the Little Key of Drawing, or Painting, is a small duodecimo volume of sixty-seven leaves of vellum, written in the twelfth century. It appears to be perfect, except a leaf torn out between pp. 64 and 65 of the modern paging, and a little cropping in two leaves.

It was purchased at Paris, in 1824, from the Rev. Mons. Allard, Curé of the church of Saint Eustache, and had previously belonged to Mons. J. Rabaut.

I have always considered it to be one of the most curious and interesting treatises relating to the art of painting, or rather the composition of colours for painting, in existence. It is very remarkable in many respects. Its antiquity exceeds that of all other works treating of similar arts with which I am acquainted. The character of the writing appears to be that used in England or Flanders in the time of Henry 2nd; but from an English word being used in the work the presumption will be, of the two nations, in favour of England. Should it be an English work, we may fairly infer that these "secrets" are those which were known to our Saxon artists and artificers. The passage which quotes the English word is in chapter 190. where the shrub "caprifolium" is translated "goat tree."* This is a singular circumstance, and seems to me to indicate, as I said before, that the author or the transcriber was an Englishman, for had he been of any other nation he would most naturally have translated it by the language of his own country. Moreover, in the very next chapter, he mentions the herb "_greningpert_," a corruption, I suspect, of "_greningwert_," the Saxon ƿ being easily mistaken for a _p_; (and we know that several English names of herbs end in _wort_,* as St. John's Wort, etc.) which I consider an additional mark of his being an English author. It is evidently the work of a person well practised in the arts which he describes, and he has apparently some classical learning, since there is little doubt that he had read Vitruvius, for he gives an extract from him, although he does not mention him by name; the chapter on Brick Walls, "De latericiis Parietibus," being, I believe, taken from that author, and probably also the chapter on Lime and Sand.

*) The term "gate" for "goat" explains the reason why the family of Yate bear three gates for their arms, and a goat's head for their crest; a gate formerly being pronounced (as it is now in some counties) a yat, or yate: both are, in fact, puns upon the name.

*) Wurt in old German and Saxon signifies a herb, as we know from the Latin name of Wurtzburgh, which is translated Herbipolis.

The author does not confine himself to the composition of colours, but treats of a variety of other subjects, in a concise and simple manner, and generally very intelligibly; as for instance, Architecture, Mensuration of Altitudes, the Art of War, etc. The various articles on these and other subjects may be summed up in the following: namely, 1. Softening gold so as to mould it with the fingers; 2. To melt gold without the aid of fire; 3. To write in gold, silver, and quicksilver letters; 4. To gild other metals; 5. To restore tarnished silver to its brilliancy; 6. To gild on stone, wood, glass, and leather; 7. To proportion buildings; 8. To build in water; 9. To build brick walls; 10. The choice of sand; 11. To make mortar; 12. To make glue for wood or bone; 13. To make glass; 14. To stain glass with various colours; 15. To stain or dye leather, bone, horn, and wood; 16. To varnish paintings; 17. To prepare size for painting on walls; 18. To make soap and starch.

He gives ns instructions in other arts, which have been long lost; such as, 1. The composition of Niello; 2. Encaustic; 3. Ancient ink; 4. The mode of softening glass, crystal, and ivory; 5. Of making fiery arrows, and empoisoning them; 6. The mode of using the battering-ram, etc.

The variety of synonyms given to the same trees, shrubs, or herbs in pp. 238 and 239 will be interesting to the botanist, and valuable to the artist, for by some one of these different names he may be able to identify a plant which would otherwise remain unknown to him. One secret the author appears to be afraid of entrusting even to his own son, or, at all events, not to his book, for he conceals the names of the materials under fictitious letters, as in chapter 212. where he speaks of the composition of a water which may be set on fire and yet the material which it surrounds shall remain unconsumed. His mode of measuring heights is simple and easy: the method of making fiery and empoisoned arrows, and of using, preserving, and improving the battering-ram, throw light upon the details of the art of warfare of that time. It may be doubtful, however, whether the soap-boiler of the present day could improve his own system by the author's.

He makes a curious remark on the nature of the ox and the horse, by a paradox, observing, that if oxen drink first, then there will be enough water for both oxen and horses; but, if the horses drink first, there will not be sufficient either for horses or oxen.

His instructions for writing in gold and silver letters are particularly interesting in the present day, when so much labour and ingenuity is expended in reviving, by fac-similes, ancient illuminated MSS.

It is observable that most of the countries, in which the materials quoted were produced, are in the East; for instance, Alexandria, Ethiopia, Persia, Cappadocia, Egypt, etc., shewing that the principal trade for these articles lay in that direction. Allusion is sometimes made to Greece and Spain, often to Italy, but rarely to Germany, France, or England. There are some passages which seem to indicate the work to have been compiled in Italy, or at least that these arts were originally developed there.

Among the more interesting facts, which the author relates, is one, which appears to me to fix a boundary to the question as to the origin of Painting in Oils, and to shew that it was, at all events, _after_ the period when this work was written by the author, that that art was discovered. The statement I allude to is this:--- In describing the mode of preserving pictures from injury by water he recommends the artist "to lay over them a coating of oil of _Cicini_."* It is clear from this that pictures were not at that time painted with colours ground up with oil, for, if they had been so, they would not need a fresh coating to preserve them from water. Now it would be very extraordinary if a person, so conversant in the composition and the use of colours as this author seems to be, who must have had consequently much intercourse with painters, should be totally ignorant of the art of mixing the colours with oil, if it really was in general practice. I may adduce, in corroboration of this supposition, the picture of Lorenzo of Venice,* painted in 1369, and described by Zanetti, which shows clearly that the practice, recommended by the author of Mappæ Clavicula, was still in use two hundred years after his own time; therefore, when it is stated that Theophilus mentions painting in oil as known before the eleventh century, the two statements seem to be irreconcilable.

*) Chapter 109.

*) See Mrs. Merrifield's "Cennini on Painting."

I have, however, a MS. of the Latin Gospels of the tenth century, in which the figures of the Evangelists are deemed, by a lady skilled in painting, to have been done in oil. They are evidently of the Greek style of painting, as may be seen by comparison with other paintings in my Greek MSS. Should this conjecture be well-founded, it would be plain that Oil-painting must have been known _before_ the _eleventh_ century. Perhaps I may hazard a conjecture, that Theophilus (a Greek name) was a Greek artist, who came into Italy, and imparted the knowledge of his art to the monk Ruggiero, and that the author of the Clavicula, being an Englishman, and far distant from Italy, had not yet acquired that secret of mixing the oil and colours, which Theophilus may have known.

To return to the contents of the Clavicula.

Another object of interest is the explanation of the Symbols of Weights and Measures, which partly resemble those now in use, and approximate also to those given by Rabanus, Abbot of Fulda, in some cases, but not in all.

Near the end of the MS. he gives two or three cases of natural magic, one of which is the now well-known experiment of water quickly whirled round in a vessel, and yet not falling out.

One of the most valuable entries in the book is one connected with philology, namely, the alphabet of Runes, if they are Runes, but which I am inclined to think arc Oscan, or very early Greek, and derived originally from the Persepolitan, or Babylonian character. Those who will compare the earliest known Greek inscriptions, such as the Sigæan, will see at onee that they are made in the same cuneiform manner as the Babylonian and Persepolitan letters, and appear to have very nearly the same form of strokes or lines, with the advantage of a more simple combination of these strokes, so as to make one character or letter. The Chinese character retains its Babylonian form to this day; and the Runes of the North I consider to be equally derived from the Babylonian, although arbitrarily altered from the Southern form, perhaps according to the will and taste of the leader who led his bands northward after the dispersion of Babel, or perhaps at a later time by some Priest or Magus of the tribe, or they may be the same characters altered in the lapse of time, like some of our own from the ancient Saxon. Some of the letters in this volume correspond with the characters of the "Lettras desconocidas," or unknown letters of Spain, as may be seen by referring to Laborde's Spain, Don Gabriel's Sallust, Velasquez, and the Oscan monuments. Those which correspond with Laborde are, ---

The alphabetical names of ag, berch, cen, derhu, I do not remember to have met with before.

I have thus, my dear Sir, at your request, undertaken the above description of this volume, but I have felt myself totally incompetent to enter upon the task in such a manner as it deserves. To do it justice I consider could only be performed by some one, who, like yourself, had studied those arts which the book describes. I must request you therefore to pardon all faults, both of criticism, of judgment, and of simple description, and beg to remain,

My dear Sir, very truly yours, 

**Thos. Phillipps.**

# Incipit Libellus Dictus Mappæ Clavicula.

Sensim per partes discuntur quælibet artes.  
Artis pictorum prior est factura colorum;  
Post, ad mixturas convertat mens tua curas;  
Tunc opus exerce, sed ad unguem cuncta coerce,  
Ut sit ad ornatum quod pinxeris, et quasi natum.  
Postea multorum documentis ingeniorum  
Ars opus augebit, sicut liber iste docebit.

## De Vermiculo.

Si vis facere Vermiculum, accipe ampullam vitream et lini deforis de luto, et sic accipe unum pondus vivi argenti, et duo pondera sulfuris albi aut crocei coloris, et mitte ipsam ampullam super 3. aut 4. petras, et adhibe ignem in circuitu ampulle ex carbonibus, ignem tamen lentissimum, et sic cooperies ampullam ex parvissima tegula: et, quando videris fumum exire ex ore ampullæ blavum, cooperi: et, quando exierit fumus crocei coloris, iterum cooperi: et, quando videris exire fumum rubeum quasi vermiculum, sic tolle ignem, et habes vermiculum optimum in ampulla.

## De Lazorio.

Si vis facere Lazorium optimum, accipe ollam novam que nunquam fuit in opus, et mitte in eam laminas purissimi argenti, quantas vis, et sic cooperi ollam et sigilla; et mitte ipsam ollam in vindemia que est projecta de torculari, et illic bene cooperi de ipsa vindemia, et serva bene usque ad 15. dies; et sic aperies ipsam ollam, et illum florem qui est in circuitu laminarum argenti excuties in nitidissimo vase. Quod si amplius volueris habere, iterum fac quod supra scriptum est.

## Item.

Si aliud Lazorium volueris facere, accipe ampullam purissimi cupri, et mitte in eam calcem usque ad medium, et sic imple illam fortissimo aceto; et ita cooperi et sigilla; et tunc mitte ipsam ampullam in terra, aut in alio aliquo calido loco, et ita dimitte usque ad unum mensem; et postea aperies ampullam. Istud Lazorium non est tam bonum sicut aliud, tamen valet ad lignum et maceriam.

## Item.

Tertium Lazorium si vis facere, accipe flores blavos et tere, et exprime in mundissimo vase; et fac prius campum in ligno et in pargameno de albo plumbo; et mitte desuper, quando fuerit siccum, ipsum colorem, et tantum ita fac, usque quo videas ipsum colorem esse similem Lazorii.

## De Viridi.

Si vis facere Viride Grecum, accipe ollam novam, et mitte in eam laminas purissimi cupri, et sic imple ipsam ollam fortissimo aceto, et ita cooperi et sigilla; et mitte ipsam ollam in aliquo calido loco, aut in terra, et ita dimitte usque ad sex menses, et tunc aperies ipsam ollam, et que in ea inveneris mitte super tabulam ligneam, et mitte ad solem siccare.

## Item.

Si vis facere Viride Rotomagense, accipe laminas purissimi cupri, et lini ipsas laminas in circuitu de optimo sapone; et mitte ipsas laminas in novam ollam, et sic imple ipsam fortissimo aceto, et ita cooperi et sigilla, et (mitte) in aliquo calido loco usque ad 15. dies; et ita aperies ollam, et executies laminas super tabulam ligneam, et mittas ad solem siccare.

## De Minio.

Si vis facere Minium, rubeum vel album, accipe ollam novam, et mitte in eam tabulas plumbeas, et imple ipsam ollam fortissimo acceto, et ita cooperies, et sigillabis; et mittes ipsam ollam in calido loco, et ita dimitte usque ad unum mensem; et postea accipe ollam, et discooperies, et quod fuerit in circuitu tabularum plumbearum excuties in alio vase fictili, et sic pones ad ignem, et semper movebis ipsum colorem, et quando videbis ipsum colorem effectum album, sicuti nix, tolles de illo quantum tibi placuerit, et ipse color vocatur Cerussa. Reliquum vero dimittes ad ignem et semper movebis, usque quo sit factus rubeus, sicuti aliud minium; et ita tolles de igne, et dimittes in ipso vase refrigerare.

## De diversis Coloribus.

Colores in pargameno spissi, et clari, hii sunt: Azorium, Vermiculum, Sanguis draconis, Carum, Minium, Folium, Auripigmentum, Viride Grecum, Gravetum Indicum, Brunum, Crocus, Minium rubeum vel album, Nigrum optimum ex carbone vitis. Hii omnes colores destemperantur a glarea.

## De Mixtionibus.

Quod si volueris scire naturas et mixtiones istorum colorum, et qui sint sibi contrarii, diligenter aurem appone.

Azorium misce cum albo plumbo, incide de indico, matiza de albo plumbo.

Vermiculum purum incides de bruno, aut de sanguine draconis, matizabis de auripigmento. Vermiculum misces cum albo plumbo, et facies colorem qui vocatur Rosa; incides de vermiculo, matizabis de albo plumbo. Item, facies colorem de sanguine draconis, et de auripigmento; incides de bruno, matizabis de auripigmento.

Carum minium incides de bruno, matizabis de rubeo minio. Item, facies Rosam de caro minio et albo plumbo; incides de caro minio, matizabis de albo plumbo.

Folium incides de bruno, matizabis de albo plumbo. Item, misces folium cum albo plumbo; incides de folio, matizabis de albo plumbo.

Auripigmentum incides de vermiculo, et ipsi matizatura non est, quia stercorat omnes alios colores.

Tamen si vis facere Gladum Viride, misces auripigmentum cum nigro; incides de nigro, matizabis de auripigmento.

Si vis facere similem, accipe azorium, misces cum albo plumbo; incides de azorio, matizabis de albo plumbo; et quando fuerit siccum cooperies de claro croco.

## Temperatura.

Viride Grecum distemperabis cum aceto; incides de nigro, matizabis de albo, quod fit de cornu cervi. Item, misces viride cum albo plumbo; incides de viride, matizabis de albo plumbo. Gravetam incides de viride, matizabis de albo plumbo. Crocum incides de vermiculo, matizabis de albo plumbo. Indicum incides de nigro, matizabis de azorio. Item, misces Indicum cum albo, incides de azorio, matizabis de albo plumbo. Brunum incides de Nigro, matizabis de rubeo minio. Item, facies de bruno et albo plumbo Rosam; incides de bruno, matizabis de albo plumbo. Item, misces Crocum cum albo plumbo, incides de croco, matizabis de albo plumbo; minium rubeum incides de bruno, matizabis de albo plumbo. Item, misces Minium cum bruno; incides de nigro, matizabis de rubeo plumbo. Item, facias Carnaturam de rubeo plumbo et albo; incides de vermiculo, matizabis de albo plumbo.

## Qui contrarii sibi sint Colores.

Modo si vis scire qui colores sibi sint contrarii, hoc est. Auripigmentum non concordat cum folio nec cum viridi, nec rubeo plumbo, nec cum albo. Viride non concordat cum folio.

Si vis facere campos, fac pulcram rosam de vermiculo et albo. Item, fac campum de folio distemperato cum calce. Item, fac campum de viridi distemperato cum acceto. Item, fac campum de ipso viridi, et quando fuerit siccum cooperies de caule.

Si vis scribere de auro, accipe pulverem auri, et distempera cum glute ipsius pargameni in quo debes scribere, et ad ignem de ipso auro cum glute scribe, et quando littera sicca fuerit, bruni de planissima petra, aut de dente apri. Item, si inde volueris vestimentum, aut picturam aliam facere, sicut superius dixi, aurum mittes in pargameno, incides de incausto, aut de indico, et matizabis de auripigmento.

# Incipit Prologus sequentis Operis.
